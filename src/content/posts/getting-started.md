# Getting Started with Static Site Generation

Static site generators (SSGs) have revolutionized how we build and deploy websites. They combine the best of both worlds: the performance of static HTML with the developer experience of modern frameworks.

## Why Static Site Generation?

1. **Performance**: Pre-rendered HTML loads incredibly fast
2. **Security**: No server-side code execution in production
3. **Scalability**: Static files can be served from CDNs globally
4. **SEO**: Search engines love static HTML

## Code Example

Here's a simple JavaScript function that demonstrates async data fetching:

```javascript
async function fetchPosts() {
  const response = await fetch('/api/posts');
  const posts = await response.json();
  return posts.filter(post => post.published);
}
```

## Working with Markdown

Markdown makes it easy to write content. You can use:

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- [Links](#) to other pages
- Lists (like this one!)
- And much more

### Images

You can include images with standard markdown syntax:

## Next Steps

1. Create more markdown files in the `content` directory
2. Customize the layout in `src/layouts/MarkdownLayout.astro`
3. Deploy your site to your favorite hosting platform

Happy writing! ðŸš€
